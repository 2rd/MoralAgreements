# MoralAgreements
##### As machines are becoming increasingly independent through rapid advances in artificial intelligence (AI) technology, questions arise about  how  ethical  principles  should  guide  their  moral  behavior.  One major challenge involves the collection and assessment of social expectations to how these questions should be solved. In this paper, we propose a framework for collection and measurement of public opinion on ethical dilemmas. Using our framework as a tool, researchers can add their own collections of dilemmas, making it simple to investigate public opinion ondilemmas of their own choosing. In other words, the framework is a plat-form for crowdsourcing both public opinion on moral dilemmas as well as moral dilemmas. We describe how gamification can be implemented to improve the experience of participating and encourage participationin  our  tool.  In  addition,  we  demonstrate  a  method  of  assessing  social expectations of AI ethics through comparison of collected data with existing moral theories. The capabilities of our framework is demonstrated through the deployment of a working prototype that implements gamification, compatibility with five moral theories, and a set of ten ethical dilemmas.
